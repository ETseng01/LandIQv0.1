# Updating Your GitHub Repository

Follow these steps to update your GitHub repository with the latest changes:

## Step 1: Download the Project Files

1. Download the project files from your local development environment.

## Step 2: Update Your GitHub Repository

### Option 1: Using GitHub's Web Interface (for smaller updates)

1. Go to your GitHub repository in your web browser.

2. For each file you want to update:
   - Navigate to the file in the repository
   - Click the pencil icon (Edit this file)
   - Replace the content with the updated version
   - At the bottom, add a commit message like "Update [filename] with latest changes"
   - Click "Commit changes"

### Option 2: Using GitHub Desktop or Git (recommended for larger updates)

1. Clone your repository locally (if you haven't already)
2. Copy the updated files to your local repository
3. Commit the changes with a message like "Update LandIQ with latest features"
4. Push the changes to GitHub

### Option 3: Upload the Entire Project (easiest but overwrites history)

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Delete all existing files (you can select all and delete in one go)
3. Upload all the files from your local copy
4. Commit the changes
