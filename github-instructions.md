# Updating Your GitHub Repository

Follow these steps to update your GitHub repository with the latest changes:

## Step 1: Download the Project Files

1. Run the download script to create a ZIP file of your project:
   ```
   npm run download
   ```

2. Once the script completes, you'll see a file named `landiq-project.zip` in your file explorer.

3. Right-click on this file and select "Download" to save it to your local machine.

## Step 2: Update Your GitHub Repository

### Option 1: Using GitHub's Web Interface (for smaller updates)

1. Go to your GitHub repository in your web browser.

2. For each file you want to update:
   - Navigate to the file in the repository
   - Click the pencil icon (Edit this file)
   - Replace the content with the updated version
   - At the bottom, add a commit message like "Update [filename] with latest changes"
   - Click "Commit changes"

### Option 2: Using GitHub Desktop or Git (recommended for larger updates)

1. Clone your repository locally (if you haven't already)
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file
3. Copy the updated files to your local repository
4. Commit the changes with a message like "Update LandIQ with latest features"
5. Push the changes to GitHub

### Option 3: Upload the Entire Project (easiest but overwrites history)

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Delete all existing files (you can select all and delete in one go)
3. Upload all the files from the extracted ZIP
4. Commit the changes

## Key Files That Were Updated

- `src/App.tsx`: Added address autofill, notifications panel, and learn more modal
- `src/index.css`: Fixed z-index issues for proper layering of UI elements

These updates improve the user experience with better search functionality and more interactive elements.
