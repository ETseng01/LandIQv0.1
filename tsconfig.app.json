/**
 * Purpose:
 * Sets compiler options and project settings for TypeScript.
 * It controls how the TypeScript compiler interacts with the project files, specifying which files to include,
 * how to handle type-checking, module resolution, JSX processing, and other compiler behaviors.
 * 
 * Key Settings:
 * - "target": Specifies the ECMAScript target version.
 * - "module": Defines the module system (ESNext).
 * - "strict": Enables all strict type-checking options for maximum type safety.
 * - "jsx": Configures JSX processing mode, set for React 17+ usage.
 * - "noEmit": True to prevent the compiler from emitting output files, useful when TypeScript is used for type-checking only.
 * 
 * Usage Notes:
 * - Ensure to review and update the "include" array to match the directory structure of your project.
 * - "moduleResolution" is set to "bundler" to optimize interaction with bundlers like Webpack or Rollup.
 * - Strict mode is turned on to enforce a higher level of type safety and best practices.
 * 
 * Modification Advice:
 * When modifying this file, consider the impact of changes on the build process and team workflows.
 * Test changes locally before applying to ensure that the compiler's behavior aligns with the project's requirements.
 * 
 * This file is integral to the TypeScript setup in our project; please handle with care and update documentation as necessary.
